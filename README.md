Developing a 3rd Person Controller is really hard and takes too much time, so we developed this awesome template so you can set up a character controller for android in less than 10 seconds, leaving space for you to focus on making your game!
This Assets are designed to work as a quick start into prototyping and developing character controllers for various game genres, using systems and methods that are easy to build and expand upon for different projects.

Third Person Controller package includes:

A Third Person Armature character controller, fully rigged and animated using a Humanoid rig with guns
A Third Person Capsule character controller
Playground Scene and level prototyping Prefabs
Triplanar shaders for quick prototyping (Built-in + ShaderGraph for URP/HDRP)=(you need to convert pipeline)
UI Canvas overlays for mobile (Joystick and Touch Zone)
